Why used the Linkedlist over ArrayList for Queue Implimentation :

1) Fast Insertion and Deletion - Linkedlist insert a element at first and deletes the element at last in O(1) time complexity , while Arraylist takes O(n) time complexity to
									Delete an element, because it need to fill the remove element position by swap operations.
 
2) ArrayList is better for storing and accessing data, where LinkedList is better for manipulating data. but in queue we need to access only first element and last element
